**whenever we upload an image it is not uploaded in form of text rather it 
is uploaded in form of multipart form data
MULTIPART FORMDATA--- file ka payload jo upload ho ra hota h wo blocks mei upload hota h ek stream ki tarah 
chote chote chunks mei upload hota h rather then ki wo pura pura ek baar mei upload ho jaaaye
FORM-URLENCODED ---(by default)data pura ka pura ek text format mei jata h url encode hokr 
so in our case we'll want ki humari image multipart formdata ki tarah jaaye
